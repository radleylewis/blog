        I am currently contracted with DCConnect Global as a Web 3.0 Software

        the telecommunications and data sector.

        In late 2020 my brother and I co-founded RT Reporting, a cloud based
        advisory software solution for accountants, bookkeepers and businesses.
        RT Reporting was exited through private sale to a US based buyer in
        mid-2023. At the time of sale RT Reporting serviced over one thousand
        small to medium sized businesses across Australia, New Zealand, the UK
        and even Papua New Guinea.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the lead engineer and co-founder, I was responsible for the
        end-to-end software development process, from customer focused feedback
        and engagement on features, to UX design and the implementation of core
        IP and business logic. RT Reporting's development team included one
        other front-end engineer and a contracted UX designer.

        From March 2019 to September 2020 I worked for myEGO in Munich, Germany.
        myEGO was a B2B platform leveraging blockchain in the pursuit of digital
        identity protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        My software engineering responsibilities spanned across React.Native
        mobile application development, backend development with Express.js and
        blockchain development using Hyperledger.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my capacity as the Product Manager and Finance Lead I played a key
        role in the successful pre-seed (~EUR300k) funding round, and oversaw
        the publication of the myEGO mobile application to both the Google Play
        Store and Apple App Store.
