  <h3>Work</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate technologist specialising in FinTech, Blockchain, Cyber
    Security and Software Engineering. I have over decade of combined technology
    and financial services experience, and enjoy solving complex real world
    problems through the application of technology. As an experienced founder, I
    have a proven track record of leading teams to successful execution of
    high-quality, production ready applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In mid-2023 I sold my last venture through private sale - RT Reporting,
    which I co-founded with my brother is a cloud-based advisory and financial
    forecasting product. Prior to this, I worked in Munich, Germany on a
    Self-Sovereign Identity blockchain project.
  </p>
  <p>
    My international banking and finance experience spans more half a decade
    across Australia, NY and HK with ANZ Bank Ltd and later HSBC. During this
    time I held roles focused on financial institutions coverage, including
    funds, hedge funds, banks, public sector and insurers.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Born in Melbourne, Australia, I was fascinated by the world, languages and
    technology from a young age. As a young kid I would listen to the BBC World
    Service on radio late into the night, a habit I've never kicked although
    these days its podcasts and books.
  </p>

  <p>
    My first computer ran a Pentium III 733mhz processor and introduced me to
    the world of technology, gaming and programming. While I spent my 20's
    studying and working in international finance, I finally came full circle in
    2018 when I left banking and turned my life long passion for tech into my
    profession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I love exploring, hiking,
    travelling and discovering new places. I have a passion for languages and
    culture, am fluent in German, conversant in Mandarin and dabble in Thai and
    Spanish.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have been lucky enough to live all around the world, including Germany,
    China/HK, Thailand and spend significant stints in the USA, Spain, Malaysia
    and Mexico.

  <h3>Technology</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Operating System:</strong> I am almost exclusively using some
    variant of <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch linux</a> these days.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Languages:</strong> I consider myself language agnostic and am most
    proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. I also have experience with
    C, Java, Lua, Rust, Solidity and Bash/POSIX shell scripting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Frameworks:</strong> This website is built with
    <a href="https://github.com/radleylewis/rssg">rssg</a>, a Static Site
    Generator I coded in Rust that has zero JavaScript out of the box. For more
    complex front-end projects I tend towards Vue.js/NUXT.js, although I have
    built applications with React.js/Redux and mobile applications with
    React.Native. On the backend I have experience with Express.js, Koa.js,
    Flask, FastAPI and Django. On the Web3 side of things I have experience with
    ethereum blockchain development including ethers.js and hardhat.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cloud:</strong> I mostly use AWS for my commercial projects.
    Cloudflare and self hosting with Raspberry Pis and old PCs for my personal
    projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Databases:</strong>
    I love MongoDB, and it is usually sufficient for what I need. I also have
    experience with SQL databases such as Postgres and MySQL along with in
    memory databases such as Redis.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Editor:</strong> I develop exclusively with
    <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> these days.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Shell:</strong> I use <a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io">zsh</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Crypto:</strong> The main crypto currency I am interest in these
    days is Monero. I stay abrest of other blockchain developments especially
    relating to self sovereign identity and Web3.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Machines:</strong> My main machines are an X1 Carbon (9th Gen)
    Lenovo ThinkPad and an
    <a href="https://www.xmg.gg/en/xmg-fusion-15-l19">XMG Fusion 15</a>. I like
    tinkering with older ThinkPad models such as the t440p and t480.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Keyboards:</strong> I am a big believer in high quality keyboards
    for long writing and coding sessions. I use a
