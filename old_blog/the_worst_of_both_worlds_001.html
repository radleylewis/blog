<h1>I'm All Right Jack</h1>

<p>Somehow, Australia has a reputation among many of being a freedom loving place. I never quite understood the premise of this stereotype, and sadly my conviction, that it is not, was ultimately justified. To be vindicated isn't always a sweet victory. I would prefer Australia was a free place, but not just in the superficial ways of speech and opinion but in a creative sense that leads rise to a prosperous and healthy society. </p>

<p>If the last 18 months have taught us anything it is that Australia has adopted many of the worst traits of its many communities that form it. On the one hand this leviathan of a country takes pride in its overly bureaucratic, high tax, high regulation customs that were inherited from our British ancestors. On the other hand, this comes entirely without the deep, thought-out consideration given to imposition of mob opinion upon the individual. By virtual of its geographic location, Australia is an Asian country, and yet the brutal, dictatorial benevolent King mindset that prevails here comes not hand in hand with Asian prosperity and and efficiency. Rather Australia is becoming the worst of both worlds.</p>

<p>How do I know this? Ultimately I have lived within enough systems to see similarities where others may not, and to understand the trade-off that always exists under the surface. China for example has become wealthy, while India has not. Why? The answer isn't a simple one. Many CCP detractors would argue that China is successful in spite of its government, not because of it. They might be right. India on the other hand? Is it poor because it is a democracy? Or poor in spite of its democracy democracy? </p>

<p><em>If voting mattered, they wouldn't let us do it.</em> - Mark Twain</p>

<p>If you still believe in democracy, you are foolishly naive, I would argue. Australia doesn't pursue the foreign policy it does in the name of freedom or democracy, but rather because it is convenient to its economic structure. It needs shipping lanes just as the US needs consumption and China "needs" buyers. Just as the left to right spectrum was always a poor model to understand politics, so too are the concepts of East and West, Developed and Developing, Rich and Poor. </p>

<p>Where would Australia sit within any of those models? For the entirety of the pandemic, and alien observer far out in space would have assumed that Australia and China were for all intents of purposes, the closest of allies. Ships are constantly floating back and forth between the two, and both use the harshest of lock-down measures to combat the current pandemic. Both governments wield significant surveillance apparatus, and seem not to care about their populations, but are hamstrung by economic realities (otherwise known as the real estate market). </p>

<p>Despite his being a citizen of this country, one rarely hears the name, Julian Assange. Every so often there is a poster on a power poll, mostly because he lived for a while in close proximity to where I am writing this. But the average Australian doesn't think about Assange. But you might argue, how can I honestly charge that Australia isn't freedom loving? Assange is only one man, and the most powerful country in the world is after him! It was his fault! (that most powerful country being supposedly also our closest ally).</p>

<p>Strangely, Australia is not really a place for misfits, even with all that empty space to hide in. It is a place where tall poppy syndrome is rife, and the nanny state is all to effective at ruining any fun. Don't have a smoke near a building for goodness sake! Make sure we tax alcohol and every other fun thing! Rich people are evil and so is America (although aren't we just a little America?). Yet before this turns into a rant, let us ask, what is the point?</p>

<p><em>The problem with Australia is not that it is a nation descended from convicts, it's that it's a nation descended from prison guards.</em> - David Moore</p>

<p>For 18 months Australia prevented it's own citizens from leaving its own shores. Of course - much like East Germany had - there was an exemption process. At any time around a third of applications were accepted, nonetheless this policy existed and was unique among "free nations". </p>
