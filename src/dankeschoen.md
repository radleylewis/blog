It's been a little while. The last two weeks in quarantine was not all bad. Sure, spending Christmas confined to a single room without a drop of Bavarian beer or family around was tough, but fortunately, there were some good lads in my block that I could chat with on breaks between coding the business project. Having lived in Germany the last two years, it feels good to be back home in Australia, albeit not on the terms I had imagined. I still have my 1994 Nissan Silvia to get running, but I don't imagine sliding back into life here should be too hard. I am not done with the adventures though, and have been thinking about a big trip through a country that has always fascinated me - but that's a topic for another time.
