# Why Decentralisation is the West's Last Hope

### Situation Report

The western world is never going to be the same. The very foundation of our civilisation has broken, and in a state of complete systems failure, all of us are retreating into tribalism, echo chambers and political short-sightedness. The western empire, lead by the United States, is more than anything, a financial empire and this is, as much as anything, a financial crisis. 

For decades, financiers and those born with a silver spoon in their mouth, have sliced off every piece of flesh from the carcass that was the industrialised western economy. Sensing that something is wrong, and that economic opportunity is ever more illusive, the general populace is confused, resentful and aggrieved. 

The fermenting anger leads to increasingly dangerous misdiagnosis by so-called experts across the proudly out-of-touch political class. The same people who, designed a system wherein China became the factory floor of the world, and who told us inflation would be transitory, now tell us that the alternative way - that is China and Russia - is a house of cards. Soft and fuzzy catch phrases like democratic values, freedom and - the latest addition - safety, help to ease the pain like an opium addiction. But words aren't enough and people are seeing through the ever widening cracks. 

### Changing teams

Your average citizen isn't alone in their journey towards enlightenment either. Entire nations, never fully accepted by the western club, are waiting at the periphery to see how it will unfold. Indeed the BRICs application queue is growing and states from Israel to Saudi Arabia are looking to diversify out of the dollar. Conversely, those at the core of the system - or who consider themselves at its core - are cutting their nose to spite their face - I'm looking at you Germany.

Unfortunately, being a financial empire requires complete faith in the systems within which we exist. In the absence of vast industrial might, the state tightens its cold hard fingers around its helpless subjects. Alas, those subjects have lost their dignity, and rather than exhibiting stone like resolve that underpins a great society, they are disintegrating into tiny pieces that slip through the closed fist of the desperate state organs. 

Panicked and puzzled the powers that be attempt to pick up all the pieces and put it all back together again. But the pieces don't fit. Politicians who aren't sure what a blockchain is, or what it does, encourage ex-factory workers to _learn to code_. Technology is rarely understood. Much in the way that governments, lacking in either integrity or financial expertise, were bullied into massive financial bailouts by Wall Street in the financial crisis, so too are they woefully ill-informed and under-qualified with respect to tech. 

Despite this fundamental misunderstanding, technology is on lips of every western leader, especially when it comes to explaining the way out of this mess. Fortunately, some think to themselves, my term is up soon. But for those who are all in, desperate times call for desperate measures, and so grandmother visits Taiwan in order to hopefully ignite some conflict abroad that will be both sufficiently large enough to distract the masses, and at the same time limited and contained enough to not fully expose that the emperor has no clothes.  

### The way out

The three most successful major western economies - the USA, Japan and Germany - all share one significant trait with respect to their financial systems. All three of these countries are decentralised, and in more way than one. They all have multiple centre's of economic gravity, lending to a distribution of economic activity across various regions, as opposed to being concentrated around a single metropolis. In Germany, Volkswagen's headquarters sits in Lower Saxony, while Toyota's is in Toyota City - look it up! The fact that industrial giants such as these auto-manufacturers appeared far from the major cities was not the result of pure luck. 

Core to the development of all three of these economies was a banking system that consisted of local community banks. That's right, not the $10,000 dollar suit wearing New York City banker variety, but rather the not-for-profit local savings society type. While such institutions might appear entirely unsexy to the aspiring finance graduate, this eco-system of local lending institutions - which in the case of Germany has existed for more than 200 years - is a far more effective conduit for effective capital deployment. Bankers actually have to know and understand the businesses into which they are deploying capital, and this is possible due to close physical proximity and local community. Knowledge around the industries within which they have financial exposure is incubated over time, so that the real risks are well understood. Furthermore, the money is created locally, and circulates within the local economy so as to further promote economic prosperity. 

In case you're not convinced that more, smaller, financial intermediaries means more economic prosperity, you might be interested to know that from 1922 to 1991 the Soviet Union had exactly one bank.

### Money is power

Because wealth was generated across a variety of regions, so too was political power and influence. There is a reason Munich is sometimes referred to as _die heimliche Hauptstadt_ (the secret capital). Unfortunately, the decades leading up to our current predicament saw ever more centralisation. 

So what does this have to do with Decentralised Finance you ask? Well, as I mentioned, the situation the west finds itself in today is more than anything a culmination of a rotten financial system. Options still exist, once again, the political class gets it wrong.
