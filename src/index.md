Dear Reader,

thank you for visiting my blog. My name is Rad and I am a coder, investor, traveller and entrepreneur among other things. This site is a dedicated space to publish my writings on politics, technology, economics, languages and the world. 

Originally from Australia, I have also lived in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New York and Germany. I speak German (C1) and some Mandarin (HSK4). I am avid hiker, amateur sailor and am most passionate about two things: 1) global political affairs and 2) revolutionising business through technology. 

Currently studying a Masters of Advanced Cyber Security from King's College London, I also hold a Bachelor of Commerce & Bachelor of Arts degree from Monash University, Melbourne.

Drop me a line if you think we could work together, or even just catch up over a beer.
