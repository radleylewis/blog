<h3>Background</h3>
<br />

<p>
  Growing up in the beautiful, hilly outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, I was
  fascinated by the world, languages and technology from a young age. As a young
  kid I would listen to the BBC World Service on radio late into the night, a
  habit I've never kicked although these days its YouTube and Podcasts.
</p>

<p>
  My first computer ran a Pentium III 733mhz processor and introduced me to the
  world of technology, gaming and programming. While I spent my 20's studying
  and working in international finance, I finally came full circle in 2018 when
  I left banking and turned my life long passion for tech into my main
  profession.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
<br />
<p>
  I am an experienced engineer with more than five years in dedicated software
  development roles and over a decade of combined financial services and
  technology experience.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than a just software engineer, I consider myself a well-rounded
  technologist focused on solving real-world problems relating to FinTech,
  PrivacyTech, IT Security and Self Sovereign Identity. I have experience
  leading teams to successful execution of complex, production ready
  applications.
</p>

<p>
  In late 2020 I co-founded - along with my brother -
  <em><a href="https://www.rtreporting.com">RT Reporting</a></em
  >, a cloud based advisory software solution for accountants, bookkeepers and
  businesses. Prior to founding RT Reporting worked as a software engineer in
  Munich, Germany on self-sovereign digital identity powered by blockchain.
</p>

<p>
  Before pivoting to software engineering and FinTech I worked in international
  banking for more than 5 years across Melbourne, and New York, Sydney and Hong
  Kong for both the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and later HSBC. Most
  of this time was spent focused on financial institutions coverage, including
  funds, hedge funds, banks, public sector and insurers.
</p>

<p>
  During my time at university I served part-time in the Australian Army Reserve
  for more than 3 years.
</p>

<br />
<h3>Favourite Places</h3>
<br />

<p>
  Since a 10 week school exchange to Schwerin in the former East Germany at the
  age of 16 I have dedicated myself to exploring and learning about the world.
  Fluent in German and conversant in Mandarin Chinese, I love languages. I've
  been lucky enough to live in Beijing, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, New York,
  Germany and also spend significant stints in Israel, India, Thailand and
  Spain.

<h3>Technology I Use</h3>
<br />

<p>
  <strong>Operating System:</strong> I am almost exclusively using some varient
  of <em><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch linux</a></em> these days.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Languages:</strong> I consider myself language agnostic and always
  open to learning new ones. I am most proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript and
  Python. I also have experience with C, Java, Lua and Bash/POSIX shell
  scripting. Right now I am learning Rust.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Frameworks:</strong> This website is built with
  <em><a href="https://romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg6</a></em> by Roman
  Zolotarev. For the front-end I tend towards Vue.js/NUXT.js, although I have
  built applications with React.js/Redux and mobile applications with
  React.Native. On the backend I have experience with Express.js, Koa.js, Flask,
  FastAPI and Django.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cloud:</strong> I mostly use AWS for my commercial projects.
  Cloudflare and self hosting with Raspberry Pis and old computers for my
  personal projects.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Databases:</strong>
  I love MongoDB, and it is usually sufficient for what I need. I also have
  experience with SQL databases such as Postgres and MySQL along with in memory
  databases such as Redis.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>IDE:</strong> In the last year I have shifted to
  <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> with
  <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> as my default editor. For
  large projects, my preferred IDE is WebStorm or PyCharm.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Shell:</strong> I use
  <em><a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io">zsh</a></em
  >.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Crypto:</strong> The only crypto currency I am interest in these days
  is Monero. I stay abrest of other blockchain developments especially relating
  to self sovereign identity and Web3.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Machines:</strong> My main machines are an X1 Carbon (6th Gen) Lenovo
  ThinkPad and an
  <em><a href="https://www.xmg.gg/en/xmg-fusion-15-l19">XMG Fusion 15</a></em
  >. I like tinkering with older ThinkPad models like the t440p too.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Keyboards:</strong> I am a big believer in high quality keyboards for
  long writing and coding sessions. Recently I got my hands on a
  <em
    ><a
      href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?utm_campaign=shipping-confirmation-email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=OrderlyEmails&amp;utm_content=product"
      >Keychron K8 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard</a
    ></em
  >. Other than this, I also have a
  <em
    ><a
      href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=5593"
      >Ducky Mecha Mini v2</a
    ></em
  >
  and a
  <em
    ><a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/DURGOD-Mechanical-Keyboard-Interface-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B078HFTTYK"
      >Durgod Taurus K320</a
    ></em
  >.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Mouse:</strong> Since my Logitech MX Master 2s broke recently I have
  shifted to the
  <em
    ><a href="https://www.rtings.com/mouse/reviews/logitech/g-pro-wireless"
      >Logitech G Pro Wireless</a
    ></em
  >. Overall, the cleaner look and more rudimentary functionality is more suited
  to my usage (especially with Linux).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Monitor:</strong> Right now I am using the
  <em
    ><a href="https://www.benq.com/en-ap/monitor/gaming/ex2780q.html"
      >EX2780Q 144Hz Gaming Monitor with HDRi Technology | BenQ</a
    ></em
  >.
