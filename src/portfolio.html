      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am an experienced engineer with more than five years in dedicated
        software development roles and over a decade of combined financial
        services and technology experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than a just software engineer, I consider myself a well-rounded
        technologist focused on solving real-world problems relating to FinTech,
        PrivacyTech, IT Security and Self Sovereign Identity. I have experience
        leading teams to successful execution of complex, production ready
        applications, a handful of which I have outlined here.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>IT Credentials</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Codeworks, Software Engineering Bootcamp</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="location">üìçBarcelona, completed in 2019</p>

      <p>
        <strong>King's College, MSc. Advanced Cyber Security</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="location">üìçLondon (Online), graduation due late 2024</p>

      <br />
      <h3>Technology I Use</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Operating System:</strong> I am almost exclusively using some
        varient of
        <em><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch linux</a></em> these days.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Languages:</strong> I consider myself language agnostic and
        always open to learning new ones. I am most proficient in
        JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and am currently learning Go. I have some
        experience with C, Java, Lua and Bash/POSIX shell scripting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Frameworks:</strong> This website is built with
        <em><a href="https://romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg6</a></em> by Roman
        Zolotarev. For the front-end I tend towards Vue.js/NUXT.js, although I
        have built applications with React.js/Redux and mobile applications with
        React.Native. On the backend I have experience with Express.js, Koa.js,
        Flask, FastAPI and Django.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Cloud:</strong> I mostly use AWS for my commercial projects.
        Cloudflare and self hosting with Raspberry Pis and old computers for my
        personal projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Databases:</strong>
        I love MongoDB, and it is usually sufficient for what I need. I also
        have experience with SQL databases such as Postgres and MySQL along with
        in memory databases such as Redis.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>IDE:</strong> In the last year I have shifted to
        <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> with
        <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> as my default
        editor. For large projects, my preferred IDE is WebStorm or PyCharm.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Shell:</strong> I use
        <em><a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io">zsh</a></em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Crypto:</strong> The only crypto currency I am interest in these
        days is Monero. I stay abrest of other blockchain developments
        especially relating to self sovereign identity and Web3.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Machines:</strong> My main machines are an X1 Carbon (6th Gen)
        Lenovo ThinkPad and an
        <em
          ><a href="https://www.xmg.gg/en/xmg-fusion-15-l19"
            >XMG Fusion 15</a
          ></em
        >. I like tinkering with older ThinkPad models like the t440p too.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Keyboards:</strong> I am a big believer in high quality
        keyboards for long writing and coding sessions. Recently I got my hands
        on a
        <em
          ><a
            href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?utm_campaign=shipping-confirmation-email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=OrderlyEmails&amp;utm_content=product"
            >Keychron K8 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard</a
          ></em
        >. Other than this, I also have a
        <em
          ><a
            href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=5593"
            >Ducky Mecha Mini v2</a
          ></em
        >
        and a
        <em
          ><a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/DURGOD-Mechanical-Keyboard-Interface-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B078HFTTYK"
            >Durgod Taurus K320</a
          ></em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mouse:</strong> Since my Logitech MX Master 2s broke recently I
        have shifted to the
        <em
          ><a
            href="https://www.rtings.com/mouse/reviews/logitech/g-pro-wireless"
            >Logitech G Pro Wireless</a
          ></em
        >. Overall, the cleaner look and more rudimentary functionality is more
        suited to my usage (especially with Linux).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Monitor:</strong> Right now I am using the
        <em
          ><a href="https://www.benq.com/en-ap/monitor/gaming/ex2780q.html"
            >EX2780Q 144Hz Gaming Monitor with HDRi Technology | BenQ</a
          ></em
        >.
