  <h3>Work</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate technologist specialising in FinTech, Blockchain, Cyber
    Security and Software Engineering. I have over decade of combined technology
    and financial services experience, and enjoy solving complex real world
    problems through the application of technology. As an experienced founder, I
    have a proven track record of leading teams to successful execution of
    high-quality, production ready applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In mid-2023 I sold my last venture through private sale - RT Reporting,
    which I co-founded with my brother is a cloud-based advisory and financial
    forecasting product. Prior to this, I worked in Munich on a Self-Sovereign
    Identity blockchain project.
  </p>
  <p>
    My international banking and finance experience includes more than five
    years across Australia, NY and HK with ANZ Bank Ltd and later HSBC. Most of
    this time was spent focused on financial institutions coverage, including
    funds, hedge funds, banks, public sector and insurers.

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Born in Melbourne, Australia, I was fascinated by the world, languages and
    technology from a young age. As a young kid I would listen to the BBC World
    Service on radio late into the night, a habit I've never kicked although
    these days its YouTube, Podcasts and books.
  </p>

  <p>
    My first computer ran a Pentium III 733mhz processor and introduced me to
    the world of technology, gaming and programming. While I spent my 20's
    studying and working in international finance, I finally came full circle in
    2018 when I left banking and turned my life long passion for tech into my
    profession.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I love exploring, hiking,
    travelling and discovering new places. I have a passion for languages and
    culture, am fluent in German, and conversant in Mandarin.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been lucky to live all around the world, including Germany, China,
    Thailand and spend significant stints in the USA, Israel, Spain, Malaysia
    and Mexico.

  <h3>Technology</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Operating System:</strong> I am almost exclusively using some
    varient of <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch linux</a> these days.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Languages:</strong> I consider myself language agnostic and always
    open to learning new ones. I am most proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript and
    Python. I also have experience with C, Java, Lua and Bash/POSIX shell
    scripting. Right now I am learning Rust.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Frameworks:</strong> This website is built with
    <a href="https://github.com/radleylewis/rssg">rssg</a>, a Static Site
    Generator I coded in Rust that has zero JavaScript out of the box. For more
    complex front-end projects I tend towards Vue.js/NUXT.js, although I have
    built applications with React.js/Redux and mobile applications with
    React.Native. On the backend I have experience with Express.js, Koa.js,
    Flask, FastAPI and Django.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cloud:</strong> I mostly use AWS for my commercial projects.
    Cloudflare and self hosting with Raspberry Pis and old computers for my
    personal projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Databases:</strong>
    I love MongoDB, and it is usually sufficient for what I need. I also have
    experience with SQL databases such as Postgres and MySQL along with in
    memory databases such as Redis.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>IDE:</strong> In the last year I have shifted exclusively to
    <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> with
    <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> as my default editor.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Shell:</strong> I use <a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io">zsh</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Crypto:</strong> The only crypto currency I am interest in these
    days is Monero. I stay abrest of other blockchain developments especially
    relating to self sovereign identity and Web3.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Machines:</strong> My main machines are an X1 Carbon (6th Gen)
    Lenovo ThinkPad and an
    <a href="https://www.xmg.gg/en/xmg-fusion-15-l19">XMG Fusion 15</a>. I like
    tinkering with older ThinkPad models like the t440p too.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Keyboards:</strong> I am a big believer in high quality keyboards
    for long writing and coding sessions. Recently I got my hands on a
    <a
      href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?utm_campaign=shipping-confirmation-email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=OrderlyEmails&amp;utm_content=product"
      >Keychron K8 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard</a
    >. Other than this, I also have a
    <a
      href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=5593"
      >Ducky Mecha Mini v2</a
    >
    and a
    <a
      href="https://www.amazon.com/DURGOD-Mechanical-Keyboard-Interface-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B078HFTTYK"
      >Durgod Taurus K320</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mouse:</strong> Since my Logitech MX Master 2s broke recently I have
    shifted to the
    <a href="https://www.rtings.com/mouse/reviews/logitech/g-pro-wireless"
      >Logitech G Pro Wireless</a
    >. Overall, the cleaner look and more rudimentary functionality is more
    suited to my usage (especially with Linux).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Monitor:</strong> Right now I am using the
    <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-ap/monitor/gaming/ex2780q.html"
      >EX2780Q 144Hz Gaming Monitor with HDRi Technology | BenQ</a
    >.
