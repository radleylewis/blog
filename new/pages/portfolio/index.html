        In late 2020 I co-founded - along with my brother - RT Reporting, a
        cloud based advisory software solution for accountants, bookkeepers and
        businesses. RT Reporting services more than 1,000 small to medium sized
        businesses across Australia, New Zealand, the UK and even Papua New
        Guinea.
      </p>
      <p>
        RT Reporting is a Xero Certified SaaS application built in
        Vue.js/NUXT.js, Express.js, FastAPI, MongoDB and Redis. As the lead
        engineer and co-founder, I am responsible for the end-to-end software
        development cycle, from customer focused feedback and engagement on
        features, to UX design and the implementation of the IP and business
        logic. RT Reporting's development team includes one other front-end
        engineer and a contracted UX designer.

        From March 2019 to September 2020 I worked for myEGO, a Germany based
        B2B platform leveraging blockchain in the pursuit of digital identity
        protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        myEGO is a bleeding edge technology approach to self sovereign identity.
        As a full-stack engineer I was responsible for for React.Native mobile
        application development, backend development with Express.js and
        blockchain development using Hyperledger.
