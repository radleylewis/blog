<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Growing up in the beautiful, hilly outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, I was fascinated by the world, languages and technology from a young age. As a young kid I would listen to the BBC World Service on radio late into the night, a habit I've never kicked although these days its YouTube and Podcasts. </p>

<p>My first computer ran a Pentium III 733mhz processor and introduced me to the world of technology, gaming and programming. While I spent my 20's studying and working in international finance, I finally came full circle in 2018 when I left banking and turned my life long passion for tech into my main profession.</p>

<h2>Favourite Places</h2>

<p>Since a 10 week school exchange to Schwerin in the former East Germany at the age of 16 I have dedicated myself to exploring and learning about the world. Fluent in German and conversant in Mandarin Chinese, I love languages. I've been lucky enough to live in Beijing, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, New York, Germany and also spend significant stints in Israel, India, Thailand and Spain. </p>

<p><strong>Germany:</strong> one of my favourite countries, and a place to which I owe a great debt.</p>

<p><strong>Hong Kong:</strong> I love the great clash of civilisations, emblematic of the situation in the world today. </p>

<p><strong>Rome:</strong> the history is humbling and reminds me of what is important.</p>

<p><strong>Beijing:</strong> no place I have ever been exudes such power.</p>

<p><strong>Chiang Mai:</strong> the perfect city for lifestyle and productivity.</p>

<h2>Professional experience</h2>

<p>In late 2020 I co-founded RT Reporting, a cloud based advisory software solution for accountants, bookkeepers and businesses. Prior to founding RT Reporting worked as a software engineer in Munich, Germany on self-sovereign digital identity powered by blockchain. </p>

<p>Before pivoting to software engineering and FinTech I worked in international banking for more than 5 years across Melbourne, and New York, Sydney and Hong Kong for both the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and later HSBC. Most of this time was spent focused on financial institutions coverage, including funds, hedge funds, banks, public sector and insurers. </p>

<p>During my time at university I served part-time in the Australian Army Reserve for more than 3 years.</p>

<h2>Tech I Use</h2>

<p><strong>Operating System:</strong> For anything business my go to OS is Fedora with KDE, for anything fun it's Arch/Artix linux.</p>

<p><strong>Languages:</strong> I consider myself language agnostic and always open to learning new technologies. I am most proficient in TypeScript, Python and am currently learning Go. I have some experience with C too.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud:</strong> I mostly use AWS for my business ventures. </p>

<p><strong>Editor:</strong> In the last year I have shifted to vim as my default editor. For large projects, my preferred IDE is VS Code.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware:</strong> My main machines are a X1 Carbon (6th Gen) Lenovo ThinkPag and a XMG Fusion 15. I like playing around with older ThinkPag models like the t440p too.</p>
