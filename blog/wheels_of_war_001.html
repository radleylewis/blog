<p><img src="../assets/wheels_of_war_001.md" alt="Letters from Iwo Jima Scene" /></p>

<p>In the 2006 film <em>Letters from Iwo Jima</em> directed by Clint Eastwood, which portrayed the battle from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers who thought in that battle, there is a scene that I keep being reminded of. In that scene, a Japanese commissioned officer who has previously spent time in the United States attempts to bring sense to his comrades who he believes underestimate their adversaries might. He alludes to the massive production capacity of the United States, which produces millions of automotive vehicles each year and controls massive amounts of natural resources. </p>

<p>Since returning to Australia in December, discussion of Chinese interests in Australia have been noticeably more prevalent than when I left in 2016. The pandemic, the fate of Hong Kong, India border skirmishes, incursions into Taiwanese airspace and a generally more assertive China further underpin a feeling that the more open China that the corporate West had hoped for has been slow to arrive, or rather will no longer be arriving. China knows that at a corporate&#47;political level the West only cares about money and has made an example of Australia through bans on coal and wine. Commentators and military experts in Australia laugh these actions off as weak, and claim China lacks sophisticated technology or projective force capabilities, and will therefore poses a only minor nuicence and no major threat. However, China is not weak but rather the factory floor of the world, and much like Japan in 1941, the West - that is to stay the United States and her allies such as Australia - are the economic underdog. Despite China detractors best efforts to assure us of our invincibility, I maintain - regretfully - that China could occupy all major Australian cities within four weeks, and all critical infrastructure within three months. Although I sincerely hope they do not take such drastic measures, were the boot on the other foot, I have no doubt our <em>democratically elected</em> leaders might strongly consider such an escapade.</p>

<p>In Purchasing Power Parity terms China&#39;s GDP is more than 20% larger than the United States. But this doesn&#39;t tell us the full picture. The economy of the United States has seen almost no real wage growth for 40 years, and its once great manufacturing base has been eroded paving an electoral path victory for Donald Trump across the rust belt in 2016. While Trumpism may have stoked a short-term economic bump, the trade deficits have continued to grow, and America&#39;s role as the world&#39;s useful idiot consumer has been solidified. A democratic regime that bows to the culture cancel mob is unlikely to arrest this trend.</p>

<p>Usually, in times of crisis, the Americans have rallied, the good patriots as they once were, behind flag and country. This was true of the Great Depression, World War I, World War II, September 11 and even the Vietnam war to some extent. Never bet against an American, so the saying goes, and for good reason, American&#39;s entrepreneurial and creative attitude has got them out of more than one difficult situation. Covid-19 should have been this moment for the United States, but instead the division that has manifested itself in the decades since the Cold War ended - and perhaps earlier - has further raised its ugly head. There is no consensus, except at the top, where both parties are for all intents and purposes completely alike, and competent only in matters pertaining to personal gain of wealth and power. </p>

<p>Whether you like it or not, if you were born in the English-speaking West, then this is your team. I have come to peace with that fact, and the United States is a prism through which to judge the state of affairs within this realm. And was a dreadful state of affairs it is. Each of the other Five Eyes members have, to some extent at least and often eagerly, imported the social woes and divisions that should more often be unique to America. </p>

<h2 id="History%20rhymes">History rhymes</h2>

<p><em>Destined for War</em> by Graham T. Allison presents an awfully simplistic view on the rise of China in the context of American hegemony. It did however present an interesting list of case studies of similar situations that have occurred throughout history. It&#39;s most significant miss in my view was the resembalence of today&#39;s world to the 1930&#39;s, especially in central and eastern Europe. Ray Dalio has highlighted this position a number of times as it relates to the economy and the trend is clear with respect to populism. I believe the parallels go well beyond this however. China is in many respects far less socialistic than the West, and under President Xi a growing confidence has emerged in China with a more ethno-nationalistic core. </p>

<p>China has every right to be proud of its more than 5,000 years of uninterrupted civilisation, its emergence as the worlds economic superpower, and its regained sway in the world. In many respects China reminds me of Germany prior to World War II and the massive ethnic German diaspora across eastern Europe, many of whom were entirely disinterested with the nationalistic tendencies of the National Socialists. In the world we live in today, it is easy to forget this as the end of the war instigated massive ethnic migrations across the European continent. Much like in Europe at the time however, the Chinese populations in Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and beyond, even if entirely unassociated with Communist China, might not be seen in that light by the CCP. </p>

<h2 id="The%20enemy%20of%20my%20enemy%20is%20my%20friend">The enemy of my enemy is my friend</h2>

<p>One might argue that China is in fact surrounded, that the free world is more than just the 5 eyes community. What of NATO, India or Japan you ask? Japan is an easy example to concede. It is absolutely true that Japan, still one of the world&#39;s largest economies despite its decades of economic malaise, sits firmly in this camp, and has enough skin in the fight, as well as geographical proximity and historical gripe to possibly tip the scales. Europe on the other hand is tired and far away, shackled mentally by its history and at a loss when it comes to it&#39;s much needed ambition. A dearth of leadership has led to a long muddling trudge apparently void of any desire for self-preservation. If the Eurozone crisis, Brexit, the migrant crisis and Covid-19 haven&#39;t killed it, then perhaps nothing will. But surviving and thriving are entirely different things at the end of the day.</p>

<p>A few years ago while living in Beijing, I was invited to the Polish embassy where a talk was being held on how India should counter China&#39;s rise. Poland was one of the first countries to recognise Communist China and was subsequently allocated formidably large spot within Beijing&#39;s diplomatic sector hosting a cinema in the basement, along with all kinds of extensive amenities within its grounds. Poland also, at least to the Chinese, is far enough away and irrelevant enough to hold such a discussion without much fuss. Trump&#39;s term was well underway at the time, and the American&#39;s were in no short supply. Initially the presentation, by an Indian-Frenchman I should add, focused on economic growth and positive developments in India. However, as questions arose around the presenters arguments, he increasingly alluded to India&#39;s relationship with the United States. If I learned anything that evening, it would be that all of India&#39;s hopes are pinned on America and the West. With that in mind, I concluded that it might not be the best idea to pin all of one&#39;s hopes on a country that is pinning all of its hopes on you. </p>

<p>China no longer respects the West. While once seen as the shining light on the hill, a generation of students that have studied in the West are all too aware of our shortcomings. China&#39;s world class infrastructure, futuristic cities and economic miracle are completely at odds with the homelessness of LA or San Francisco, the dilapidated streets of New York, violent crime in Chicago or decay of once great cities like Detroit. There is more to China than meets the eye, there is excruciating poverty in the interior and corruption is rife. But it is equally true that the West is in many respects just as corrupt, and suffering from massive societal issues and imbalances. China however passes one simple test, was this year better than the year before, will next year be better than this year. In my lifetime China has passed this test year after year, something that cannot be said of the West.</p>
