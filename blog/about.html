<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Growing up in the beautiful, hilly outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, I was fascinated by the world, languages and technology from a young age. As a young kid I would listen to the BBC World Service on radio late into the night, a habit I've never kicked although these days its YouTube and Podcasts. </p>

<p>My first computer ran a Pentium III 733mhz processor and introduced me to the world of technology, gaming and programming. While I spent my 20's studying and working in international finance, I finally came full circle in 2018 when I left banking and turned my life long passion for tech into my main profession.</p>

<h3>Professional experience</h3>

<p>In late 2020 I co-founded - along with my brother - <em><a href="https://www.rtreporting.com">RT Reporting</a></em>, a cloud based advisory software solution for accountants, bookkeepers and businesses. Prior to founding RT Reporting worked as a software engineer in Munich, Germany on self-sovereign digital identity powered by blockchain. </p>

<p>Before pivoting to software engineering and FinTech I worked in international banking for more than 5 years across Melbourne, and New York, Sydney and Hong Kong for both the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and later HSBC. Most of this time was spent focused on financial institutions coverage, including funds, hedge funds, banks, public sector and insurers. </p>

<p>During my time at university I served part-time in the Australian Army Reserve for more than 3 years.</p>

<h3>Tech I Use</h3>

<p><strong>Operating System:</strong> For anything business my go to OS is <em><a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a></em>, for other stuff it's <em><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch linux</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Languages:</strong> I consider myself language agnostic and always open to learning new technologies. I am most proficient in TypeScript, Python and am currently learning Go. I have some experience with C and Bash/POSIX shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Frameworks:</strong> This website is built with <em><a href="https://romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg6</a></em> by Roman Zolotarev. For the front-end I tend towards Vue.js, although I have built applications with React.js and mobile applications with React.Native. On the backend I have experience with Express.js, Koa.js, Flask and Django. </p>

<p><strong>Cloud:</strong> I mostly use AWS for my business ventures. Still trying out providers for my personal projects.</p>

<p><strong>Editor:</strong> In the last year I have shifted to vim as my default editor. For large projects, my preferred IDE is VS Code.</p>

<p><strong>Shell:</strong> I use <em><a href="https://fishshell.com">fish</a></em>. </p>

<p><strong>Machines:</strong> My main machines are an X1 Carbon (6th Gen) Lenovo ThinkPad and an <em><a href="https://www.xmg.gg/en/xmg-fusion-15-l19">XMG Fusion 15</a></em>. I like tinkering with older ThinkPad models like the t440p too.</p>

<p><strong>Keyboards:</strong> I am a big believer in high quality keyboards for long writing and coding sessions. Recently I got my hands on a <em><a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-tenkeyless-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?utm_campaign=shipping-confirmation-email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=OrderlyEmails&amp;utm_content=product">Keychron K8 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard</a></em>. Other than this, I also have a <em><a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=5593">Ducky Mecha Mini v2</a></em> and a <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DURGOD-Mechanical-Keyboard-Interface-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B078HFTTYK">Durgod Taurus K320</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Mouse:</strong> Since my Logitech MX Master 2s broke recently I have shifted to the <em><a href="https://www.rtings.com/mouse/reviews/logitech/g-pro-wireless">Logitech G Pro Wireless</a></em>. Overall, the cleaner look and more rudimentary functionality is more suited to my usage (especially with Linux).</p>

<p><strong>Monitor:</strong> Right now I am using the <em><a href="https://www.mi.com/th/monitor34">Mi Curved Gaming Monitor 34"</a></em>.</p>

<h3>Favourite Places</h3>

<p>Since a 10 week school exchange to Schwerin in the former East Germany at the age of 16 I have dedicated myself to exploring and learning about the world. Fluent in German and conversant in Mandarin Chinese, I love languages. I've been lucky enough to live in Beijing, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, New York, Germany and also spend significant stints in Israel, India, Thailand and Spain. </p>

<p>üá©üá™ My unofficial second home and one of my favourite countries. It is a place to which I owe a great debt.</p>

<p>üá≠üá∞ I was lucky enough to live here for two years from 2016-2018. No place better represents the clash of civilisations that is unfolding in the world today.</p>

<p>üáÆüáπ The only place on the list where I haven't actually lived, but somewhere I can't stop visiting.</p>

<p>üá®üá≥ I first visited China in 2011 and have travelled through the interior, as well as to most of the major cities. I've been back many times since, including spending half a year in Beijing, and it only gets better each time.</p>

<p>üáπüá≠ Chiang Mai is my current base and the perfect the intersection of lifestyle and productivity.</p>
